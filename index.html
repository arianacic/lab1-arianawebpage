    <h1>Ariana's Makeup Routine</h1>
    <p>This is Ariana's makeup routine specifically for school because it has become second nature and she wants to share it with you! Hopefully this webpage will leave you with some good recommendations and influences you to try makeup if you never have before.</p>
    <h2>Ariana's Favourite Product</h2>
    <p>In honour of Ariana sharing her school makeup routine, she has been so kind and has given a recommendation of her favourite product below. Everyone say "Thank You Ariana!". Ariana uses this product no matter what the destination is. It has become her holy grail and she has backups ready incase she runs out of her current one.</p>
    <img src="https://www.kroger.com/product/images/large/front/0007124968100" alt="picture of L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Panorama Mascara Waterproof with a swatch of the colour 703 BLACK." width="400" >
    <p>This is the L'Oreal Paris Voluminous Panorama Mascara Waterproof. It can be found in drugstores and Walmarts, and its retail price is anywhere from $20-$30.</p>
    <p>This is Ariana's favourite product because this mascara does a great job in lengthening the lashes. It also keeps her straight lashes curled all day with no fallout. Ariana knows she can depend on this mascara to not do her eyelashes dirty. She applies around 2-3 coats to achieve her desired look.</p>
